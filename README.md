# Blockchain Implementation
  
python3 main.py

Main builds the chain, adds over a dozen random transactions and hosts the webserver.  

The updated data structure can be retrieved as a JSON payload via: http://127.0.0.1:5000/chain


####TODO:
- POST for adding more transactions to the data structure.
- Proof of Work computational algorithm. Currently exponential increase is too high to apply.
